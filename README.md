# Movie Quiz

## Description

The movie quiz is a short app that lets you guess the Rotten Tomatoes score of a popular movie. When you guess correct or incorrect you are redirected to an Info page that shows the YouTube Trailer of the correct movie. The game also calculates scores and stores them to localStorage and displays those at the end.
